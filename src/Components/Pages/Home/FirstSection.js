                    <p class="py-6">60% of rubber used in the tire industry is synthetic rubber, produced from petroleum-derived hydrocarbons, although natural rubber is still necessary for the remaining 40%.Synthetic elastomers deform under stress and return to their original shape when the stress is removed hysteresis.This property is extremely valuable for the manufacture of high-grip tires. Synthetic rubber also provides other specific properties, most notably in the areas of longevity and rolling resistance. Itâ€™s mainly used for passenger car and motorcycle tire as it gives them good grip performances.
